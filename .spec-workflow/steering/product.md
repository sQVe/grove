# Grove Product Vision

## Mission Statement

Grove transforms Git worktree management from a complex, expert-level feature into an intuitive, branch-like experience that any developer can master. We make parallel development workflows accessible, reliable, and fast.

## Product Vision

**"Make Git worktrees as simple as switching branches"**

Grove eliminates the friction of managing multiple Git worktrees by providing a fast, cross-platform CLI that handles the complexity while exposing an intuitive interface. Developers should be able to work on multiple features, bug fixes, and experiments simultaneously without worrying about git state conflicts or complex worktree management.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Feature Developers**: Working on multiple features simultaneously, need clean separation
- **Bug Fix Teams**: Managing hotfixes while continuing feature development  
- **Code Reviewers**: Need quick access to different branches without losing local changes
- **Open Source Contributors**: Working on multiple PRs across different branches

### Secondary Users
- **Team Leads**: Setting up consistent development workflows across teams
- **DevOps Engineers**: Integrating worktree workflows into CI/CD pipelines
- **Enterprise Developers**: Large codebases requiring parallel development streams

## User Value Propositions

### Core Value: Simplified Parallel Development
- **Instead of**: Complex git worktree commands, branch switching with stashing, multiple repository clones
- **Grove provides**: Simple commands (`grove create feature/auth`, `grove switch main`) that handle complexity automatically
- **User gets**: Clean, isolated development environments without cognitive overhead

### Key Benefits

#### 1. Developer Productivity
- **Instant context switching** between different features/branches without losing work
- **No stash/unstash cycles** - each worktree maintains its own state
- **Parallel development** without conflicts or mixed changes
- **Fast setup** - Grove automates the worktree creation and management process

#### 2. Workflow Reliability
- **Cross-platform consistency** across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Robust error handling** with clear, actionable error messages
- **Safe operations** with validation and confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- **Smart cleanup** to prevent disk space issues and stale worktree accumulation

#### 3. Team Collaboration
- **Standardized workflows** through consistent tooling and conventions
- **Integration readiness** for GitHub PRs, Linear issues, and team processes
- **Documentation and examples** that make adoption straightforward
- **Shell integration** for seamless terminal experience

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- **Installation growth**: Monthly active installations across platforms
- **Command usage**: Frequency of core commands (create, list, switch, remove)
- **Retention**: Users who continue using Grove after 30 days
- **Community engagement**: GitHub stars, issues, discussions, contributions

### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to productivity**: How quickly new users complete first successful worktree workflow
- **Error reduction**: Decreased frequency of Git-related workflow errors
- **Workflow efficiency**: Reduced time for common parallel development tasks
- **User satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score, GitHub issue sentiment analysis

### Technical Quality Metrics
- **Reliability**: Error rates for core operations across platforms
- **Performance**: Command execution time for typical repository sizes
- **Test coverage**: Maintained above 90% for confidence in releases
- **Cross-platform parity**: Feature availability and behavior consistency

- **Success indicator**: 90%+ success rate for init and config operations

### Phase 2: Core Commands (Current Focus)
- **Value target**: Complete worktree lifecycle management
- **User impact**: Daily development workflow supported end-to-end
- **Success indicator**: Users can replace manual worktree commands with Grove

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- **Value target**: Power user features and workflow optimization
- **User impact**: Advanced users get productivity multipliers
- **Success indicator**: Increased daily active usage, reduced support requests

### Phase 4: Integrations & Polish
- **Value target**: Professional-grade tool with ecosystem integration
- **User impact**: Seamless integration into existing development workflows
- **Success indicator**: Enterprise adoption, integration with popular development tools

## Competitive Positioning

### Differentiators
1. **Simplicity First**: Unlike raw Git worktree commands, Grove prioritizes usability over flexibility
2. **Cross-Platform Native**: Built for consistent behavior across all major development platforms
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages, progress indicators, and intuitive command structure
4. **Integration Ready**: Designed for future integration with GitHub, Linear, and other development tools

### Success Definition
Grove succeeds when developers think of worktree management as "easy" rather than "expert-level", enabling more teams to adopt parallel development workflows that improve their productivity and code quality.

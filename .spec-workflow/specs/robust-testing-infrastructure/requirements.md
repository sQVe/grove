# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Robust Testing Infrastructure feature establishes a comprehensive, isolated, and parallel-safe testing framework for the Grove CLI application. This infrastructure addresses the critical need for reliable testing of Git-heavy operations while ensuring complete isolation between test runs and enabling parallel execution for fast development feedback.

The feature implements a hybrid testing strategy combining unit tests with GitCommander interface abstraction and integration tests using the testscript framework, providing both fast development feedback and high-fidelity end-to-end validation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports Grove's product principles:

- **Speed First**: Fast unit tests provide immediate feedback, while parallel test execution ensures quick CI/CD pipelines
- **Reliable Automation**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions and ensures reliable Git operations
- **Developer Focused**: Professional-grade testing infrastructure improves developer confidence and productivity
- **Tool Integration**: Enables confident integration with development tools like Claude Code through thorough testing

By establishing robust testing practices, this feature supports Grove's mission to transform Git worktrees into an essential productivity tool by ensuring the reliability and quality expected from production developer tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Isolated Unit Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want unit tests that run in complete isolation from Git operations, so that I can test business logic quickly and reliably without filesystem dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a unit test is executed THEN it SHALL NOT touch the filesystem or execute real Git commands
2. WHEN multiple unit tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with each other
3. IF a unit test mocks Git operations THEN it SHALL use testify/mock for clear expectations and verification
4. WHEN a unit test fails THEN it SHALL provide clear indication of which specific logic failed
5. WHEN all unit tests run THEN they SHALL complete in under 10 seconds total

### Requirement 2: GitCommander Interface Abstraction

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want Git operations abstracted behind an interface, so that I can test command logic without executing real Git commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production code needs to execute Git commands THEN it SHALL use the GitCommander interface
2. WHEN unit tests need to simulate Git responses THEN they SHALL use MockGitCommander with predefined responses
3. IF a service requires Git operations THEN it SHALL accept GitCommander via dependency injection
4. WHEN GitCommander methods are called THEN they SHALL provide access to stdout, stderr, and error information
5. WHEN production code runs THEN it SHALL use LiveGitCommander that executes real Git commands

### Requirement 3: Integration Testing with testscript

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want integration tests that validate the complete CLI behavior against real Git operations, so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an integration test runs THEN it SHALL execute the compiled Grove binary in an isolated environment
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL use real Git repositories created in temporary directories
3. IF multiple integration tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL NOT share Git repositories or filesystem state
4. WHEN an integration test completes THEN it SHALL automatically clean up all temporary files and directories
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use testscript framework with txtar test scripts

### Requirement 4: Parallel Test Execution

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want all tests to run in parallel safely, so that I can get fast feedback during development and CI/CD.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests execute THEN they SHALL run in parallel without conflicts
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL run in parallel in isolated environments
3. IF tests create temporary files THEN each test SHALL use a unique temporary directory
4. WHEN tests access configuration THEN they SHALL use isolated configuration files
5. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL complete in under 2 minutes total

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want high test coverage across all components, so that I can confidently refactor and add features without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL maintain 90%+ coverage across all packages
2. WHEN new code is added THEN it SHALL include corresponding unit tests
3. IF a command exists THEN it SHALL have both unit tests and integration tests
4. WHEN error conditions exist THEN they SHALL be covered by tests
5. WHEN Git operations fail THEN error handling SHALL be tested with mocked failures

### Requirement 6: Cross-Platform Test Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want tests to run consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that Grove works reliably on all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run on different platforms THEN they SHALL produce consistent results
2. WHEN file paths are used in tests THEN they SHALL use platform-appropriate separators
3. IF Git output differs between platforms THEN tests SHALL check for essential content rather than exact matches
4. WHEN temporary directories are created THEN they SHALL use platform-appropriate locations
5. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL work on all supported platforms

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want testing integrated into the development workflow, so that I can run specific test types and get clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `mage test:unit` THEN it SHALL execute only fast unit tests
2. WHEN I run `mage test:integration` THEN it SHALL execute only integration tests with build tags
3. IF I run `mage test:all` THEN it SHALL execute both unit and integration tests
4. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
5. WHEN coverage is requested THEN it SHALL generate HTML coverage reports

### Requirement 8: Testing Utilities and Helpers

**User Story:** As a Grove developer, I want shared testing utilities, so that I can easily create consistent test setups and assertions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need Git repositories THEN they SHALL use testutils helpers for creation
2. WHEN tests need to verify Git state THEN they SHALL use standardized assertion helpers
3. IF tests require complex setup THEN they SHALL use reusable fixture functions
4. WHEN tests need mocks THEN they SHALL use centralized mock implementations
5. WHEN tests create temporary data THEN they SHALL use testutils for automatic cleanup

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Unit test suite SHALL complete in under 10 seconds
- Integration test suite SHALL complete in under 90 seconds
- Parallel test execution SHALL utilize all available CPU cores
- Test setup overhead SHALL be minimized through efficient temporary directory creation
- Memory usage during tests SHALL scale reasonably with test count

### Security

- Test environments SHALL be completely isolated from production Git repositories
- Temporary files SHALL be created with appropriate permissions (0755 for directories, 0644 for files)
- Test configurations SHALL NOT access real user configuration files
- Mock implementations SHALL NOT execute real Git commands
- Test data SHALL NOT contain sensitive information

### Reliability

- Tests SHALL be deterministic and produce consistent results across runs
- Test isolation SHALL prevent any cross-test contamination
- Failed tests SHALL clean up temporary resources
- Test failures SHALL provide actionable debugging information
- Test infrastructure SHALL handle Git operation failures gracefully

### Usability

- Test execution SHALL provide clear progress indication
- Test failures SHALL include specific file locations and error context
- Debugging information SHALL be preserved when tests fail (using testscript -work flag)
- Test naming SHALL follow consistent conventions for easy identification
- Documentation SHALL explain how to run and debug different test types

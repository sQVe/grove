# Implementation Tasks: Ensure Code Quality via Pre-commit Hook

## Task Overview

This document breaks down the implementation of pre-commit hooks for Grove into simple, executable tasks focused on configuration, documentation, and manual verification.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Core Pre-commit Configuration

- [x]   1. Create .pre-commit-config.yaml configuration file
    - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in project root
    - Configure TekWizely/pre-commit-golang repository integration
    - Set up golangci-lint hook with --fix argument and lint alias
    - Pin to stable version (v1.0.0-rc.1 or latest)
    - _Leverage: Existing .golangci.yml configuration (auto-detected)_
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

### Phase 2: Documentation and Setup Instructions

- [x]   2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md with pre-commit setup instructions
    - Add "Pre-commit Hooks" section to existing CONTRIBUTING.md
    - Document pre-commit installation steps for Windows/macOS/Linux
    - Explain integration with existing `mage lint` workflow
    - Add troubleshooting section for common setup issues
    - Include hook bypass instructions using `--no-verify`
    - Add workflow examples showing commit with violations → auto-fix → success
    - Document emergency bypass workflow for urgent commits
    - _Leverage: Existing CONTRIBUTING.md structure and format_
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4_

### Phase 3: Manual Verification

- [x]   3. Test pre-commit setup manually
    - Install pre-commit following the documentation steps
    - Run `pre-commit install` to set up the hooks
    - Create a test commit with intentional linting violations
    - Verify golangci-lint runs and applies auto-fixes
    - Test commit blocking with unfixable violations
    - Verify `git commit --no-verify` bypass works
    - _Leverage: Existing .golangci.yml configuration_
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 6.1, 6.3_

### Phase 4: Project Integration

- [x]   4. Update project README with pre-commit mention
    - Add brief mention of pre-commit hooks in README.md Features section
    - Link to CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed setup instructions
    - Keep addition minimal and focused on developer benefits
    - _Leverage: Existing README.md structure and tone_
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 3.3_

## Task Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies:**

- Task 1 → Task 2 (need config file before documenting setup)
- Task 2 → Task 3 (complete documentation before manual testing)
- Task 3 → Task 4 (verify setup works before updating README)

**Simple Linear Execution:**
Tasks should be executed in order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing Go conventions and patterns in Grove codebase
- Maintain consistency with current documentation style in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for configuration

### Manual Testing Requirements

- Test all documented installation steps actually work
- Verify hook execution with real linting violations
- Confirm auto-fix functionality works as expected
- Test emergency bypass scenarios

### File Organization

- Configuration file goes in project root
- Documentation updates go in existing `docs/` directory structure
- README updates maintain existing structure and tone

### Backwards Compatibility

- Zero modifications to existing `.golangci.yml` configuration
- No changes to existing `mage` commands or workflows
- All existing functionality must continue to work unchanged
- Pre-commit integration is purely additive

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Pre-commit configuration file created and functional
- [ ] Clear setup documentation with troubleshooting guidance
- [ ] Integration with existing .golangci.yml without modifications
- [ ] Manual verification confirms setup works end-to-end

### Quality Requirements

- [ ] Documentation is clear and actionable for new contributors
- [ ] Existing developer workflow remains unchanged
- [ ] Configuration follows Grove's established patterns
- [ ] All documented steps have been manually tested

### Developer Experience Requirements

- [ ] Setup process is straightforward and well-documented
- [ ] Emergency bypass options are clearly documented
- [ ] Integration enhances rather than hinders productivity
- [ ] Hook execution provides clear feedback on success/failure

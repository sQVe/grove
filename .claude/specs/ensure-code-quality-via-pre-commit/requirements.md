# Requirements: Ensure Code Quality via Pre-commit Hook

## Project Context

Grove is a Go CLI tool for Git worktree management with existing quality infrastructure:

- **Build System**: Mage with comprehensive targets (`lint`, `test:unit`, `build:all`)
- **Linting**: golangci-lint with formatters (gofumpt, goimports) configured in `.golangci.yml`
- **Testing**: 96.4% test coverage with unit and integration tests
- **Standards**: Conventional commits, clear code guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Code Reuse Analysis

**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage:**

- `mage lint` command (runs golangci-lint with --fix automatically)
- Comprehensive `.golangci.yml` configuration with formatters enabled
- Existing `internal/testutils/` package for testing utilities
- Well-defined contributor workflow in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Integration Points:**

- Pre-commit hooks will leverage existing .golangci.yml configuration
- Use TekWizely/pre-commit-golang for Go-specific hook implementations
- Focus on golangci-lint only (includes go fmt, go vet, and formatters)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pre-commit Hook Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks automatically configured, so that code quality checks run before every commit without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer clones the repository THEN pre-commit configuration SHALL be present in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
2. WHEN pre-commit is installed THEN hooks SHALL be automatically configured for Go development
3. IF pre-commit is not installed THEN clear installation instructions SHALL be provided in documentation

### Requirement 2: Code Linting and Formatting Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic linting and formatting before commits, so that code style is consistent and follows project standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN golangci-lint SHALL run using existing `.golangci.yml` configuration
2. WHEN linting issues are found THEN they SHALL be automatically fixed where possible
3. WHEN unfixable linting issues exist THEN the commit SHALL be blocked with clear error messages
4. WHEN formatting is needed THEN gofumpt and goimports SHALL run automatically via golangci-lint

### Requirement 3: Developer Experience Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks to integrate seamlessly with existing workflow, so that my development process is enhanced not hindered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pre-commit hooks are enabled THEN existing Mage commands SHALL still work independently
2. WHEN hooks run THEN they SHALL use the same linting configurations as manual `mage lint` command
3. WHEN hooks complete THEN clear success/failure messages SHALL be displayed
4. IF hooks are slow THEN developers SHALL have options to skip or configure specific checks

### Requirement 4: Documentation and Setup

**User Story:** As a new contributor, I want clear setup instructions for pre-commit hooks, so that I can quickly get productive without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading CONTRIBUTING.md THEN pre-commit setup instructions SHALL be clearly documented
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN all dependencies SHALL be installable with provided commands
3. WHEN setup is complete THEN developers SHALL be able to verify hook functionality
4. IF setup fails THEN troubleshooting guidance SHALL be available

### Requirement 5: Cross-platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer on any platform, I want pre-commit hooks to work consistently, so that the experience is uniform across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Windows THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN using macOS THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN using Linux THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL function correctly
4. WHEN platform-specific issues occur THEN clear error messages SHALL guide resolution

### Requirement 6: Hook Performance and Feedback

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks to be fast and provide clear feedback, so that I stay productive and understand any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all hooks pass THEN total execution time SHALL be under 5 seconds
2. WHEN hooks are running THEN progress indicators SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN hooks fail THEN specific failure reasons SHALL be clearly communicated
4. WHEN hooks complete THEN a summary of actions taken SHALL be displayed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Hook execution SHALL complete in under 5 seconds for typical changes
- golangci-lint SHALL complete in under 3 seconds (using existing configuration)

### Maintainability

- Pre-commit configuration SHALL leverage existing .golangci.yml config to avoid duplication
- Hook setup SHALL integrate with existing development workflow documented in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Changes SHALL maintain compatibility with existing CI pipeline

### Reliability

- Hooks SHALL have consistent behavior across all supported platforms
- Hook failures SHALL not corrupt git repository state
- Recovery from hook failures SHALL be straightforward

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Clear guidance when pre-commit or Go tools are not installed
2. **Hook Bypass**: Ability to bypass hooks for emergency commits using `--no-verify`
3. **Partial Failures**: Granular reporting when some hooks pass and others fail
4. **Large Changesets**: Performance considerations for commits with many file changes
5. **Network Issues**: Graceful handling when downloading hook dependencies fails

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Pre-commit hooks integrate seamlessly with existing workflow
2. ✅ Code quality is enforced consistently before commits through golangci-lint only
3. ✅ Developer productivity is enhanced, not hindered by slow operations
4. ✅ New contributors can set up hooks following clear documentation
5. ✅ Existing CI pipeline behavior is maintained and complemented
6. ✅ Cross-platform compatibility matches existing project standards

# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

The implementation will follow the established service-oriented architecture pattern used throughout Grove, with clear separation of concerns between CLI handling, business logic, and Git operations. The tasks prioritize leveraging existing infrastructure and patterns to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Steering Document Compliance

**Structure.md Compliance:**

- Command implementation in `/internal/commands/create.go`
- Unit tests in `create_test.go`, integration tests in `create_integration_test.go`
- Error handling using centralized patterns from `/internal/errors/`
- Follow configuration hierarchy: CLI flags → env vars → config files → defaults

**Tech.md Compliance:**

- Use Cobra + Viper following existing command patterns
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage with testify framework
- Leverage Charm Bracelet Lipgloss for consistent terminal styling
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for robustness

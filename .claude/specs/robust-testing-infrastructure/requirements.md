# Robust Testing Infrastructure Requirements

## Overview

Create a comprehensive testing infrastructure to eliminate test brittleness and improve reliability across unit and integration tests.

## Problem Statement

Current testing approach suffers from:

- Working directory dependencies causing build failures
- Filesystem state pollution between test runs
- Environment variable contamination
- Path conflicts between concurrent tests
- Manual cleanup requirements

## User Stories

### US-1: Integration Test Reliability

**As a developer**, I want integration tests to run consistently regardless of working directory, so that tests pass in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are run from any directory THEN they should build and execute successfully
2. WHEN multiple test runs occur THEN previous artifacts should not interfere with new tests
3. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages should clearly indicate the root cause

### US-2: Unit Test Isolation

**As a developer**, I want unit tests to be completely isolated from each other, so that test order doesn't affect results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests use filesystem operations THEN they should use unique paths per test
2. WHEN tests create temporary files THEN cleanup should be automatic
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they should not conflict with each other

### US-3: Environment Independence

**As a developer**, I want tests to run in clean environments, so that local configuration doesn't affect test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they should use minimal, controlled environment variables
2. WHEN tests change working directory THEN changes should be isolated to that test
3. WHEN tests complete THEN original environment should be restored

### US-4: Developer Experience

**As a developer**, I want simple, fluent APIs for robust testing, so that writing reliable tests is easier than writing brittle ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing integration tests THEN helper APIs should be intuitive and discoverable
2. WHEN writing unit tests THEN common patterns should have built-in support
3. WHEN debugging test failures THEN error messages should be actionable

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Integration Test Helper

- Automatic project root discovery using `runtime.Caller()`
- Binary build caching with proper error handling
- Clean execution environment with isolated temp directories
- Support for directory-specific test execution

### FR-2: Unit Test Helper

- Unique path generation per test to prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup registration with Go's `t.Cleanup()`
- Temporary file/directory creation utilities
- File existence assertion helpers

### FR-3: Test Runner

- Environment variable isolation and restoration
- Working directory isolation with automatic restoration
- Filesystem cleanup with configurable glob patterns
- Fluent API for composing isolation behaviors

### FR-4: Build System Integration

- Go module-aware project root discovery
- Cross-platform binary building (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Proper error propagation with actionable messages
- Build result caching to avoid redundant compilation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- Binary builds should be cached and reused across tests
- Filesystem cleanup should be efficient for large test suites
- Path generation should be fast enough for parallel test execution

### NFR-2: Reliability

- Test isolation should be complete - no shared state leakage
- Cleanup should be guaranteed even if tests panic
- Error messages should clearly indicate configuration issues

### NFR-3: Maintainability

- APIs should follow Go testing conventions
- Code should be well-documented with examples
- Implementation should be testable itself

### NFR-4: Compatibility

- Must work with existing test patterns
- Should integrate with Go's testing package
- Must support both unit and integration test workflows

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero flaky tests** due to environment issues
2. **100% test isolation** - tests can run in any order
3. **Cross-platform compatibility** for all development environments
4. **Developer adoption** - new tests use robust patterns by default
5. **Maintenance reduction** - fewer test-related issues in CI/CD

## Out of Scope

- Test result reporting or visualization
- Test performance profiling
- Mock/stub generation utilities
- Database test fixtures (handled separately)
- Network service mocking (handled separately)

## Dependencies

- Go's `testing` package
- `runtime` package for call stack inspection
- `os` and `filepath` packages for filesystem operations
- `testify` for assertions (existing dependency)

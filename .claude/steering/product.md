# Product Vision

## Mission

Grove transforms Git worktrees from a complex power-user feature into an essential productivity tool for developers, making worktree management as simple as branch switching.

## Target Users

**Primary Audience**: Individual developers working with multiple branches simultaneously

## Core Problems Solved

1. **Complex Setup**: Eliminates the friction of Git worktree initialization and configuration
2. **Navigation Difficulty**: Provides seamless movement between different worktrees
3. **Cleanup Overhead**: Automates cleanup of stale and merged worktrees
4. **Tool Integration**: Enables smooth workflows with development tools like Claude Code across different worktrees in the same project

## Product Principles

- **Speed First**: Operations must be snappy and quick - no waiting
- **Intuitive Interface**: Commands should feel natural to Git users
- **Reliable Automation**: Smart cleanup without data loss
- **Developer Focused**: Built by developers, for developers

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time from idea to working branch (setup speed)
- Seamless context switching between features
- Zero accidental data loss during cleanup
- Positive developer experience with tool integrations

## Value Proposition

Transform your Git workflow from "I'll just stash and switch branches" to "I'll create a worktree and work in parallel" - making multi-branch development the default, not the exception.

# Grove - Git worktree management

[preserve]
# Files to copy from the current worktree when creating a new one.
# Useful for environment files and local configuration that shouldn't be in git.
# Supports glob patterns. These patterns override git config grove.preserve.
# Default: .env, .env.keys, .env.local, .env.*.local, .envrc, .grove.toml,
#          *.local.json, *.local.toml, *.local.yaml, *.local.yml,
#          docker-compose.override.yml

[hooks]
# Shell commands to run after creating a worktree.
# Runs sequentially, stops on first failure.
# Examples: ["npm install"], ["go mod download", "make setup"]
# Default: []
add = []

[autolock]
# Branch patterns to automatically lock when creating worktrees.
# Locked worktrees are protected from accidental deletion.
# Supports exact matches and trailing /* wildcards (e.g., "release/*").
# Default: ["develop", "main", "master"]
patterns = ["develop", "main", "master"]

# Use Nerd Font icons in output (when not in plain mode).
# Default: true
nerd_fonts = true

# Threshold for marking worktrees as stale (no commits within this period).
# Format: number followed by d (days), w (weeks), or m (months).
# Default: "30d"
stale_threshold = "30d"

# Disable colors and symbols in output.
# Default: false
plain = false

# Enable debug logging.
# Default: false
debug = false

# Grove Development Roadmap

> **This is the unified development roadmap for Grove.** All implementation plans, feature development, and technical improvements are tracked here.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project vision

Grove is a fast, intuitive Git worktree management CLI that makes worktrees as simple as switching branches. The development follows a phased approach building from foundation to advanced features.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Development phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (v0.1.0) âœ… **COMPLETE**

**Objective**: Establish robust foundation with core infrastructure and basic commands.

#### âœ… Completed features

**Repository Management**

```bash
grove init                   # Initialize bare repo in current directory
grove init <directory>       # Initialize in specified directory
grove init <remote-url>      # Clone remote with worktree structure
grove init <remote-url> --branches=main,develop,feature/auth  # Multi-branch setup
```

**Configuration System**

```bash
grove config list                  # Show all configuration
grove config get general.editor    # Get a specific value
grove config set git.max_retries 5 # Set a configuration value
grove config validate              # Validate current configuration
grove config path                  # Show config file paths
grove config init                  # Create default config file
grove config reset [key]           # Reset to defaults
```

**Infrastructure Completed**

- âœ… CLI version support (`grove --version`)

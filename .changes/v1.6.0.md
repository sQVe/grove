## [v1.6.0](https://github.com/sQVe/grove/releases/tag/v1.6.0) - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Fallback worktree selection by directory name when branch doesn't match, enabling file preservation when primary worktree is on a feature branch ([#79](https://github.com/sQVe/grove/issues/79))
- Show worktree directory alongside branch name in prune output for easier identification ([#81](https://github.com/sQVe/grove/issues/81))

## v1.5 Requirements

**Core Value:** Users get consistent, polished output with progress feedback and clear error messages

### Spinners

- [x] **SPIN-01**: Spinner API provides StopWithSuccess() and StopWithError() methods
- [x] **SPIN-02**: Spinner API provides Update() method to change message mid-operation
- [x] **SPIN-03**: Multi-step operations show "Step N/M: action" format
- [x] **SPIN-04**: Batch operations show summary ("Removed 3 worktrees")
- [x] **SPIN-05**: `grove list` shows spinner while gathering worktree status
- [x] **SPIN-06**: `grove clone` shows spinner during clone operation
- [x] **SPIN-07**: `grove doctor` shows spinner during remote reachability checks
- [x] **SPIN-08**: `grove prune` shows spinner during fetch operation

### Streaming

- [x] **STRM-01**: Hook output streams in real-time during `grove add`
- [x] **STRM-02**: Hook output includes prefix identifying which hook is running

### Output Clarity

- [x] **CLRT-01**: `grove remove` shows full path of deleted worktree
- [x] **CLRT-02**: All commands use consistent past-tense verbs (Created, Deleted, Updated)
- [x] **CLRT-03**: Error messages include actionable hints where applicable
- [x] **CLRT-04**: Commands use logger package consistently (no bare fmt.Print for user output)
- [x] **CLRT-05**: Commands show consistent empty state messages when no results

### Error Hints

- [x] **HINT-01**: "worktree already exists" suggests using existing or different name
- [x] **HINT-02**: "cannot delete current worktree" suggests switching first
- [x] **HINT-03**: "already locked" suggests unlock command
- [x] **HINT-04**: "cannot rename current worktree" suggests switch command

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

### Extended Machine Output

- **JSON-01**: `grove list` supports --json flag
- **JSON-02**: `grove status` supports --json flag
- **JSON-03**: `grove doctor` supports --json flag

### Advanced Progress

- **PROG-01**: Time estimates for long operations
- **PROG-02**: Progress bars for known-length operations

### Additional Polish

- **PLSH-01**: `--dry-run` flag for destructive commands (remove, exec)
- **PLSH-02**: Specialized logger.Hint() method with distinct styling
- **PLSH-03**: Batch operation intermediate success logging

## Out of Scope

| Feature                         | Reason                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Interactive TUI                 | Grove is CLI-first, TUI is separate concern |
| Custom spinner animations       | Single spinner style is sufficient          |
| Color-only semantic information | Accessibility concern — icons required      |
| Verbose "helpful" messages      | Keep output minimal and purposeful          |
| --json on all commands          | Focus on UX first, machine output later     |
| Concurrent spinner display      | Single spinner at a time is sufficient      |

## Traceability
